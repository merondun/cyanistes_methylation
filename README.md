# Blue Tit 5mC Pilot

This project aims to investigate 5mC methylation varition among a pedigree of Blue Tits and assess reproducibility across batches and protocols. The directory structure of this project is as follows:

## Directory Structure

- `bisulfite_conversion`: Barebones scripts for examining bisulfite conversion success.

- `conda_environments`: Contains the Conda environments.

- `cpg_extraction`: Contains scripts for extracting 5mC CpG methylation for each sample and overlapping them into a large matrix. 

- `general`: Contains general utility scripts and files that don't belong to any specific part of the analysis but are used throughout the project.

- `metadata_n467_pilots.txt`: This text file contains metadata for the 467 pilot samples used in the project.

- `pedigree`: This directory contains information about the pedigree of the Blue Tits.

- `rrbs_processing`: Contains scripts and data related to Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) and additionally EM-Seq with an MspI application.

- `sra_upload_organization`: Contains barebones scripts for parsing for upload to the Sequence Read Archive (SRA).

- `technical_replicates`: Scripts to assess reproducibility among samples.
