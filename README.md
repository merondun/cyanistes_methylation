# Blue Tit 5mC Variation among Families

This project aims to investigate the variation of 5mC methylation among a pedigree of Blue Tits. The directory structure of this project is as follows:

## Directory Structure

- `bisulfite_conversion`: This directory contains the data and scripts used for the conversion of genomic DNA via bisulfite treatment, which is an essential preprocessing step for studying DNA methylation.

- `conda_environments`: Contains the Conda environments necessary to replicate the computational analyses performed in this study. Conda is a platform that simplifies package management and deployment.

- `cpg_extraction`: Contains scripts for extracting CpG sites from the processed genomic data. These sites are the regions where DNA methylation primarily occurs.

- `general`: Contains general utility scripts and files that don't belong to any specific part of the analysis but are used throughout the project.

- `metadata_n384_pilots.txt`: This text file contains metadata for the 384 pilot samples used in the project.

- `pedigree`: This directory contains information about the pedigree of the Blue Tits that are the subject of this study.

- `rrbs_processing`: Contains scripts and data related to Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS), a method used for studying DNA methylation.

- `sra_upload_organization`: Contains files organized for upload to the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), a public repository for sequencing data.

- `technical_replicates`: This directory contains information and data about the technical replicates used in the project.
