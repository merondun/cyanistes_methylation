# WGBS and EM-seq WGS Scripts

This repository contains a series of scripts for the processing of WGBS and EM-seq WGS data, specifically aligned to the blue tit reference genome.

1. `1.align_to_cyanistes_reference_wgbs.sh ` - Aligns the PE WGBS reads to the Cyanistes reference genome provided a prefix with sample ID and SRR accession, includes deduplication.
2. `1.align_to_cyanistes_reference_EMseq-WGSG.sh ` - Aligns the PE EM-Seq WGS reads to the Cyanistes reference genome. I specify the R1 and R2 files with a prefix explicitly as no accessions exist atm.
