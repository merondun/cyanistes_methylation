# Plotting Pedigree

Simple scripts for examining technical reproducility between tech reps.

1. `1.tech_reps_in_subset_batches.R` - Examine correlations in a subset of samples. Will extract all tech reps for a sample and a few random inter-individual comparisons to examine correlations. 
2. `2.BA_plots_tech_reps.R` - Examine reproducibility with Bland-Altman plots, which will show WITHIN ONE replicate, methylation values on the X and variation between replicates on the Y.
